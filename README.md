# Apki-Awaz

 This web application allows you to communicate using Indian Sign Language, which is used by millions of people in India who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. By using this application, you can type messages that will be displayed in sign language or use your hands to create gestures that will be "
         translated into text messages. This application is meant to bridge the communication gap between those who know 
         sign language and those who do not, making communication easier and more accessible for everyone.
