# Apki-Awaj

Our web application is specifically designed to help bridge the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who do not know Indian Sign Language. With the help of this application, users can easily communicate with each other using sign language gestures that will be translated into letters.

This application is particularly useful for people living in India, where millions of individuals rely on Indian Sign Language for communication. By enabling people to communicate more easily, regardless of their familiarity with sign language, we hope to make communication more accessible for everyone. Our goal is to help promote inclusivity and improve communication for all.

### Our project aims to develop an application that facilitates communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. The app comprises of three components:


#### 1. Sign-to-text converter: This feature allows users to input sign language, which is then converted to text and displayed on the screen.
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

#### 2. FAQ section: The app includes a FAQ section that is linked to specific letters. Users can select a letter and view the corresponding FAQ.

```sh
streamlit run text.py
```

#### 3. Voice converter: The app also includes a voice converter that can read out the answers to the FAQs
```sh
streamlit run speak.py
```
